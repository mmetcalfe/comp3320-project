\begin{abstract}

    This report serves as an update to our team's graphics project proposal -
    last updated in Module 1.  We outline what we have achieved, and the
    changes we have made to what we propose to acheive in the remaining project
    timeframe.

\end{abstract}

\section*{Project Schedule}
    
    Due to time constraints imposed by other courses, not all work planned for Module 2 has been completed.

    Two of the four tasks planned for Module 2 have been completed successfully and on schedule, these being \taskname{Procedurally generated asteroids} and 
    \taskname{Dynamic reflection mapping}.

    Due to the increasingly sluggish performance of the game as new features are added, it was decided that we should begin using deferred rendering to render the graphics as opposed to forward rendering. Work on this improvement is nearly complete (see the \taskname{Deferred shading} task on the Gantt chart).

    The tasks \taskname{Spaceship model (exterior)} and \taskname{Procedurally
    generated planets} have been removed from the scope of the project, as well
    as the optional tasks \taskname{Screen-space ambient occlusion},
    \taskname{Integrate motion tracking system}, and \taskname{Add Oculus Rift
    support}.

    Unfortunately, due to an extended period of illness, one of our team
    members, Matthew Bray, had to drop COMP3320 before he could complete any of
    his assigned work.
    Matthew was assigned the two major content creation tasks, \taskname{Robot model}, and \taskname{Spaceship model (interior)},
    which have been rescheduled for the Project Deadline.

    Only three tasks remain to be completed to meet the requirements of the
    project: \taskname{Soft shadows}, \taskname{Robot model}, and
    \taskname{Spaceship model (interior)}.

    The updated Gantt chart in Figure~\ref{gantt:module2} specifies when
    we completed each of the tasks in module 2, and
    presents a program to achieve the revised project schedule.
    The original Gantt charts from the proposal and from Module 1 are included as Figure~\ref{gantt:proposal} and Figure~\ref{gantt:module1} respectively.
