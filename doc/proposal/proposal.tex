\begin{abstract}

    This project aims to implement an ideal virtual environment for testing an
    enhanced virtual reality (VR) setup that utilises an Oculus Rift
    paired with an OptiTrack 3D motion capture system.
    The limited motion capture volume of this VR system requires a test scene
    that naturally limits the user to a small area.
    To meet this requirement, we propose to create an interactive 3D game that
    allows the player to explore the interior of a small spaceship. The
    spaceship will feature large windows, allowing the player to view a
    procedurally generated space visualisation outside the ship - maximising
    the user's sense of space and scale.

% Oculus Rift \& Motion Capture:
%     Our group wishes to eventually combine the Oculus Rift with an OptiTrack 3D
%     motion capture system to create a 3D virtual reality environment.

%     Must be a small, enclosed environment, to discourage the player from
%     leaving the motion capture range, or walking into walls/obstacles in the
%     room.

%     A virtual spaceship interior could be ideal.

%     Focus on creating a ideal 3D environment for testing the potential impact
%     of the technology on the VR experience.

%     Focus on creating an effective sense of space and scale, and avoiding
%     distracting visual artifacts.

\section*{Background}

    The Oculus Rift is a head-mounted VR display developed by Oculus VR. It
    contains a pair of LCD displays and lenses to provide stereoscopic vision
    to the user, and also provides an IMU for tracking the orientation of the
    user's head. Together, these allow an effective VR experience, provided
    that the position of the user's head does not change. If an external motion
    capture system were used (e.g. the University's OptiTrack system) instead
    of just the built-in IMU, the users range of movement could be increased to
    the entire motion capture volume of the system. This would allow a
    significantly more realistic VR experience, provided that the 3D
    environment naturally limits the user to the motion capture volume.

    Our project aims to create an interactive 3D environment that could act as
    an ideal test-bed for this VR system.

\section*{Project Description}
    
    Our team will create an interactive 3D game that allows the player to
    explore the interior of a small spaceship. The spaceship will feature large
    windows, allowing the player to view a procedurally generated space
    visualisation outside the ship. The possibility of allowing the player to
    control the ship will be considered. An animated 3D robot will roam the
    spaceship to satisfy the robot theme.

    We intend for our game to be used to help test the impact of motion capture
    technology on the VR experience. To ensure it is effective in doing so, we
    will focus on creating an effective sense of space and scale, avoiding
    distracting visual artifacts, and maintaining a high  frame-rate.
